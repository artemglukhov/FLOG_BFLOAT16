## Features

### Format
BFloat16FPU supports the BFloat16 floating-point format.
BFloat16 is a truncated 16-bit version of the 32-bit IEEE 754 single-precision
floating-point format (Float32), with the intent of accelerating machine
learning and near-sensor computing. It preserves the range of 32-bit
floating-point numbers by retaining 8 exponent bits, but supports only an
8-bit precision rather than the 24-bit significand of the Float32 format.

### Operations
BFloat16FPU supports the follwing operations:
- Addition/Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Comparisons
- Conversions between BFloat16 and signed integer (32-bit) formats

Some compliance issues with IEEE 754-2008 are currently known to exist.

### Rounding modes
BFloat16FPU supports the following IEEE 754-2008 rounding modes:
- roundTiesToEven
- roundTowardZero
